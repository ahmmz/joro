/**
 * The automation canvas: drag boxes, add boxes, drag port to port to wire them.
 *
 * The same construction as TriggerCanvas, and deliberately so — an operator who has built a
 * trigger should not have to learn a second set of gestures. React Flow does pan, zoom,
 * dragging and selection; this file owns which ports exist, what may connect to what, and
 * what a node looks like.
 *
 * The graph stays the document. React Flow's nodes and edges are derived from it on every
 * render and never held as separate state, positions included, so a drag writes straight
 * back to the graph and there is no synchronisation step that can be skipped.
 *
 * One case has no document to write to. A script whose body is hand-written is shown as a
 * wiring diagram — what wakes it, the body, what it produces — derived from the manifest
 * rather than stored, because it holds nothing the manifest does not. Its boxes
 * still drag: the positions live in this component and are forgotten on unmount, which is
 * the honest behaviour for a picture that is itself recomputed. Adding and removing a
 * trigger there is real, because that writes the manifest's trigger list.
 *
 * The rail lives outside this component — see FlowRail. The editor owns one rail for the
 * whole surface, so the automation's own settings and the selected box's are in the same
 * place rather than in two competing sidebars.
