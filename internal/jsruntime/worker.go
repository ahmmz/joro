// The worker boundary.
//
// A run executes in a second process — a re-exec of the host binary in worker mode —
// and the two halves speak JSON over its stdin and stdout. That buys three things a
// single process cannot:
//
//   - Termination is a kill, not a request. goja's Interrupt is reliable for
//     computation but it is still cooperation; a signal to a process is not.
//   - A memory blowup costs the worker. goja has no allocation ceiling, so the only
//     honest answer to "what if the script allocates 8 GB" is that something dies —
//     and Joro holds captured traffic in memory, so it must not be Joro.
//   - The JSON-only data boundary stops being a rule someone has to keep and becomes
//     a property of the transport. A Go pointer cannot be written to a pipe.
//
// The cost is a process spawn per run, tens of milliseconds against a run measured in
// seconds. Event-driven triggers will want a warm pool; a one-shot script does not.
