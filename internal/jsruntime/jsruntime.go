// Package jsruntime executes one JavaScript program under hard limits.
//
// It imports nothing from the rest of Joro, and that is the point. The runtime is
// handed a HostBridge whose only method takes a capability ID and a blob of JSON, so
// there is no field on any type in this package through which a script could reach a
// capture store, a token file, or an HTTP client. The bridge implementation lives
// elsewhere and is the only thing that knows what a capability is.
//
// Two Runtime implementations ship here:
//
//   - VM runs goja in the calling process. Fast, but a script sharing the Go heap can
//     allocate until the operating system kills that process.
//   - WorkerRuntime re-execs a host binary in worker mode and speaks to it over pipes.
//     A run is then terminated by killing a process rather than by asking a VM to
//     stop, and an allocation blowup takes the worker instead of the proxy.
//
// Joro uses WorkerRuntime. VM exists because the worker needs it: the child process
// calls it with a bridge that forwards over the pipe. Keeping both behind one
// interface is also what lets the untrusted-execution tier be replaced later without
// touching the SDK surface or any script anyone has written.
//
// # What the sandbox is, and is not
//
// A script can affect the outside world only by calling a capability. goja's default
// global object holds ECMAScript built-ins and nothing else — no process, no require,
// no fetch, no timers — so there is no ambient authority to take away, only a bridge
// to add. Combined with the worker boundary, a run cannot outlive its deadline,
// cannot exhaust the proxy's memory, and cannot reach the filesystem or a socket.
//
// It is not a defense against a deliberate engine exploit, and it does not need to
// be: any process running as the operator can already drive Joro's whole API. What
// this contains is the realistic failure — a generated script that loops forever,
// allocates without bound, or calls one capability ten thousand times.
