// Package jsautomation runs installed automations: sandboxed JavaScript against Joro's
// capability registry, and local commands.
//
// It owns three things the execution tiers deliberately do not: the principal a run acts
// as, the budget the run is held to, and the record of what it did. jsruntime knows how to
// execute JavaScript and nothing about Joro; localcmd knows how to supervise a process and
// nothing about Joro; this package knows about Joro and nothing about either.
//
// The dependency shape is the interesting part. This package is handed an Invoker — the
// sealed capability registry behind a three-method interface — and never a service
// object. A script's reach is therefore exactly the registry's, evaluated call by call
// with the registry's own guard, limits and audit trail. There is no second
// authorization path to keep in step, and no host function that could grow one.
//
// # Two kinds, one lifecycle
//
// The package name says JavaScript and the package no longer only runs it, which is worth
// a sentence rather than leaving a reader to notice. Manifest.Kind selects the execution
// half; everything around it is shared, deliberately and completely — the same store, the
// same trigger dispatcher, the same lens declaration, the same operator overrides, the
// same bounded run log. A second package for commands would have meant a second copy of
// each of those, and the copies would have drifted.
//
// The two halves differ in exactly one way that matters, and command.go states it at
// length: a script's authority is a grant bundle the registry evaluates call by call,
// while a command's authority is the operator having armed it. There is no capability for
// running a local command and no way to grant one — see Store.InstallAs and Invoke.
