// Installed automations live in ~/.joro/automations/<id>/ as three files:
//
//	joro.json         the manifest, author-owned
//	<entrypoint>.js   the source, a real file an operator can open in their own editor
//	joro.state.json   enabled / limits / triggers / revisions, operator-owned
//
// On disk rather than in a project config, because a project config is published to
// teammates: shipping executable code that runs against the full SDK bundle is exactly
// the privilege transfer that keeps automation tokens out of project configs too. The
// consequence is that automations are machine-global, which is also why "enabled" is.
//
// Three files rather than one, for two reasons. The source has to be a real .js file —
// a pentester will open it in their own editor, and a JSON-escaped source string is
// hostile to that. And operator state is separate from author state so installing an
// update never silently reverts a lowered limit or a trigger someone switched off.
//
// # A command package has two files, not three
//
// KindCommand has no source file. Its body is the manifest's command block, and its
// Source is that block rendered — see sourceOf. The argument for a real .js file does
// not carry over: a spec is structured data a form edits, not text an author writes, so
// there is nothing for an editor to open and a second copy on disk beside the manifest
// would be a thing to drift.
//
// Everything downstream still works, because Source is what the record machinery is
// written against: the hash identifies the exact command, the revision list tracks
// changes to it, and the run log retains verbatim what ran. Which means editing an
// argument cuts a revision while editing a description does not — the description is not
// part of what runs, so it is not part of what is rendered.
