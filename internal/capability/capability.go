// Package capability is the authorization layer for Joro's automation surface.
//
// Every operation exposed to an automation client is registered exactly once as a
// Capability, and every invocation goes through Registry.Invoke, which applies
// authorization, scope, rate and concurrency limits, an output-size cap, and an
// audit record. A consumer (the MCP server) never calls a handler directly, so
// there is no path that skips the guard.
//
// This package is pure policy. It imports no other internal package: it defines
// ScopeChecker rather than importing internal/proxy, and it defines Principal
// rather than importing internal/automation. The second of those is load-bearing —
// because internal/automation imports this package, Go's import-cycle rule makes it
// impossible for code here to reach the token store. Grant administration is
// therefore not merely un-registered as a capability, it is unreachable from one.
// See reserved.go for the rest of that argument.
