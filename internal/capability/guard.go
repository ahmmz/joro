// agent reach any host whenever the operator had not configured scope — the exact
// state a fresh install is in.
//
// The second clause ANDs rather than ORs. A host whitelist that could stand in for
// a disabled scope would reintroduce that same hole through a different field, so
// an operator who wants "just this host, scope off" has to say so explicitly by
// clearing RequireScope, which every audit entry then records.

// A nil ScopeChecker means Joro has no scope to consult (it should not happen in
