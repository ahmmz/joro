// insecure (CBC, 3DES) and the static-RSA key-exchange suites that Go 1.22+
// dropped from the default ClientHello. We advertise all of them when talking
// to upstream/target servers because pentest targets are frequently legacy or
// misconfigured boxes that only accept old suites; matching curl/OpenSSL reach
// matters far more than enforcing modern crypto on a connection we already MITM
// and never certificate-verify.
//
// Caveat: Go's crypto/tls implements no finite-field DHE (TLS_DHE_*) suites, so
// a server that offers ONLY DHE key exchange remains unreachable regardless of
// this list. TLS 1.3 suites are not configurable in Go and stay enabled.

// frequently a legacy box we MITM and never validate; the destinations this is for are the
// operator's own — a notification endpoint whose URL is itself the credential, so posting one
// over an unverified connection hands it to whoever answered. It lives in this file so the
// rule that no caller outside internal/proxy builds a tls.Config stays true, and so both
// postures are read side by side rather than one being discovered later.

// insecure is a per-destination opt-in for an internal receiver with a self-signed
// certificate, which is the case that would otherwise push an operator to a worse workaround.
