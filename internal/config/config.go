	// NoAutomation disables the capability registry, the automation token store
	// and the MCP listener entirely: no routes registered, no second port bound,
	// no token file read. A deployment-posture switch, in the same family as
	// --allowed-host and --disable-update-checks, not a way to invoke a feature.
	NoAutomation bool
	// AutomationPrivileged registers the execution and C2 capabilities. Off by
	// default; even when on, no token profile grants one, so the operator must select
	// each by hand. A launch flag rather than a Settings toggle so enabling it cannot
	// happen without a restart.
	AutomationPrivileged bool
	// AutomationScripting registers script.run, which executes submitted JavaScript in
	// a sandboxed worker process against a fixed SDK bundle. Its own flag rather than
	// riding on AutomationPrivileged, which means web shell and C2 specifically: an
	// operator should be able to allow scripting without allowing command execution,
	// or the reverse. Same posture otherwise — off by default, no profile grants it,
	// and a restart is required to change it.
	AutomationScripting bool
	// AutomationCommands allows installed command automations to run: packages whose
	// body is a local operating-system command rather than a sandboxed script. Off by
	// default, and a launch flag for a stronger reason than the two above — this is the
	// one automation surface with no capability behind it, so there is no grant to
	// withhold and no registry guard to evaluate. The flag and the operator's decision
	// to arm a package are its whole control.
	//
	// When off, command packages still load and list, and the UI names this flag. An
	// operator who installed one should be told why it will not run rather than left
	// wondering whether it is broken.
	AutomationCommands bool
	// NoWebhooks disables outbound webhooks entirely: no routes registered, no
	// webhooks.json read or written, no dispatcher subscribed to the event bus. A
	// deployment-posture switch in the same family as NoAutomation, and the answer for an
	// engagement where nothing may leave the machine — a webhook is the one feature whose
	// bytes go somewhere Joro's scope does not describe.
	NoWebhooks bool
	// NoPlugins skips loading plugins from ~/.joro/plugins/ — the files are still
	// listed, so the UI can delete one, but no plugin code runs.
	//
	// This is a recovery switch, not only a posture one. A Go plugin is dlopen'd
	// before the API server starts, and the runtime can throw on a file it will not
	// accept, so a plugin the host cannot load is a binary that will not boot. Every
	// other route out of that state needs a shell in ~/.joro/plugins/.
