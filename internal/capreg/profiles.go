// Profiles are curated grant bundles, so issuing a correctly-shaped token is one
// click rather than thirty checkboxes.
//
// The load-bearing rule: a profile is expanded into a concrete list of capability IDs
// when the token is created, and the profile is never stored on the token as a live
// reference. This is the no-wildcard rule from internal/automation applied one level
// up. A profile that gains a send-capable or mutating capability in a later release
// must not retroactively widen a token issued today; the existing per-token
// "capabilities you have not granted" machinery surfaces the addition instead, and the
// operator decides.
//
// Profiles are declared here, in the same package as the capabilities, so
// validateProfiles can check every ID against the registry at startup. There is no
// operator-defined profile: these are a convenience over the grant picker, not a
// second place where authorization lives.

// Profile is a named grant bundle plus the token settings it expects.
